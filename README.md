# Expense Tracker

A simple web application to help users track their daily expenses. Built using **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The app allows users to add expenses, categorize them, and view their total spending, with data stored in **localStorage** for persistence.

## Features

- **View Expense List**: Displays a list of expenses with details (amount, category, date, description) and allows filtering by category.
- **Calculate Total Expenses**: Shows the total amount spent, updating dynamically.
- **Data Persistence**: Saves expenses to `localStorage` to retain data after page reload.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a user-friendly layout on all screen sizes.

### Bonus Features (If implemented)
